# Backend Implementation Plan ‚Üí See SPRINT_PLAN.md

## üìç This document has been merged into:
- **SPRINT_PLAN.md** - Day-by-day implementation plan
- **API_SPEC.md** - Detailed endpoint specifications

## üöÄ Current Approach
We're using a backend-first strategy with clear API contracts.

### What Gadget Handles Automatically:
- ‚úÖ Error handling & monitoring (built-in)
- ‚úÖ Webhook reliability (automatic retries)
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting (per shop, automatic)
- ‚úÖ Database & caching (Redis included)
- ‚úÖ Security (handled by platform)
- ‚úÖ API creation (auto-generated)
- ‚úÖ Background jobs (built-in)
- ‚úÖ Performance optimization (serverless)

### Original Plan (ARCHIVED):
The original plan below required 50-60 hours of backend work. With Gadget, this is reduced to 15-20 hours of actual feature development!

## Original Overview (For Reference)
This document outlined the backend features needed to make Mergely production-ready, split between in-code implementation and n8n automation workflows.

## üí° Notes

1. **Priority**: Focus on stability and reliability first
2. **Testing**: Each feature needs unit and integration tests
3. **Documentation**: Update README with new features
4. **Security**: Regular security audits required
5. **Scalability**: Design for 1000+ shops from day one

This plan reduces the original 75-90 hour estimate to approximately 60-70 hours by leveraging n8n for non-critical backend tasks.
