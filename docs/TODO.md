## üìã Phase 3: Theme Integration

### 3.1 App Block Development ‚è±Ô∏è 3-4 hours
- [ ] Create bundle display app block for theme integration
- [ ] Build grid/slider/modal/selection/stepper layouts in theme extension
- [x] Check which slider library to use - **DECIDED: Embla Carousel (7.67KB gzipped, no dependencies)**
- [ ] Decide which settings go in theme customizer (style settings only) vs app dashboard settings
- [ ] Determine best strategy for bundling logic in checkout and adding to cart for each layout type - consider different blocks/sections structure

### 3.2 Customer Experience ‚è±Ô∏è 2-3 hours
- [ ] Add real-time price calculation
- [ ] Add combination image functionality - users upload images in app dashboard for each combination of products (2, 3, or more) and it displays in store when those specific products are selected together

#### Backend Agent Prompt:
```
Implement Combination Images functionality according to Contract 10 in AGENT_CONTRACTS.md.

Tasks:
1. Create new metaobject definition "bundle_combination" with fields:
   - products (list of product references)
   - image (file reference)
   - title (single line text, optional)

2. Update existing bundle metaobject to add:
   - combination_images (list of metaobject references to bundle_combination)

3. Create API endpoints as specified in Contract 10:
   - GET /app/api/bundles/:bundleId/combinations
   - POST /app/api/bundles/:bundleId/combinations (handle base64 image upload to Shopify Files API)
   - PUT /app/api/bundles/:bundleId/combinations/:combinationId
   - DELETE /app/api/bundles/:bundleId/combinations/:combinationId

4. Update storefront bundle endpoint to include combinations for theme display

5. Implement efficient matching logic using sorted product IDs

Important: Follow the exact types and field names in Contract 10. Test with multiple combinations across different steps.
```

#### Frontend Agent Prompt:
```
Implement Combination Images tab in Bundle Form according to Contract 10 in AGENT_CONTRACTS.md.

Tasks:
1. Add "Combination Images" tab after "Steps" tab in BundleForm component

2. Create CombinationImagesTab component that:
   - Shows all products from bundle steps organized by 2-product, 3-product sections
   - Generates possible combinations dynamically
   - Allows image upload for each combination
   - Shows preview of uploaded images
   - Handles delete/update operations

3. Create CombinationPicker component for selecting products
   - Multi-select from all bundle products
   - Shows which step each product comes from
   - Minimum 2 products required

4. Use Shopify Polaris components:
   - DropZone for image uploads
   - ResourceList for displaying combinations
   - Modal for add/edit flows

5. Convert images to base64 before sending to API

Important: Follow exact props and interfaces in Contract 10. Tab should be intuitive - users select products, upload image, save.
```

#### Theme Agent Prompt (for later):
```
Implement combination image display in theme blocks.

When customers select products in the bundle:
1. Get all selected product IDs
2. Sort them for consistent matching
3. Find matching combination using the findCombinationImage function
4. Display the combination image if found
5. Fall back to default product images if no match

Use the combinations data from StorefrontBundleWithCombinations response.
```
