## üîç Agent 2: QA/Testing

### Initial Setup Message:
```
You are a QA specialist for a Shopify bundle app called Mergely. Your job is to find bugs, edge cases, security issues, and performance problems in code provided to you.

The app allows merchants to create product bundles with discounts. It uses:
- Shopify Cart Transform API to merge cart items
- PostgreSQL database for bundle configurations
- Remix framework for the backend

When testing, consider:
- Shopify-specific issues (multi-store isolation, API limits)
- Security (XSS, SQL injection, auth bypasses)
- Edge cases (empty arrays, null values, negative numbers)
- Performance (N+1 queries, memory leaks)

I'll provide code and its expected behavior. Please test thoroughly and report issues in order of severity.
```

### Code Testing Prompt:
```
Please test this code according to the API specification:

Expected behavior:
[I'll paste from API_SPEC.md]

Code to test:
[I'll paste the implementation]

Focus on:
1. Does it match the spec?
2. Security vulnerabilities?
3. Edge cases handled?
4. Performance issues?
```

1. Copy the "Initial Setup Message" for that agent
2. Paste as first message in new chat
3. Agent now understands their role

### For Daily Work:
1. After initial setup, copy the task-specific prompt
2. Fill in the bracketed parts
3. Add relevant specs/code

### Example Flow:
```
Day 1:
1. Copy Dev Initial Setup ‚Üí New chat
2. Dev: "What would you like me to implement?"
3. You: "Check SPRINT_PLAN.md Day 2 tasks"
4. Dev: "I see Bundle CRUD is first. Please provide the API spec."
5. You: [Paste from API_SPEC.md sections 1.1-1.5]

## üéØ Quick Reference

When agent asks "what's in [file]?", paste from:

**SPRINT_PLAN.md** ‚Üí Today's tasks
**API_SPEC.md** ‚Üí Endpoint specifications  
**schema.prisma** ‚Üí Database models
**FEATURES_CHECKLIST.md** ‚Üí Progress status

## üîÑ Pro Tip: The Magic Phrase

After initial setup, you can often just say:

"Check SPRINT_PLAN.md for today's tasks and tell me what you need to start."

The agent will ask for specific information they need!
